Not so long ago, computers were given instructions for data processing by reading stiff pieces of paper called ["punched" cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card). The cards have 80 columns of numbers with 12 "punch" locations in each column. We named our firm around that bit of nostalgic simplicity.
