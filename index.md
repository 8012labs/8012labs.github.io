8012 Labs (pronounced "eighty twelve labs") is a software development firm based in Brooklyn, New York.

We build and operate web applications (have you checked out [Status Hero](https://statushero.com) yet?) and provide consulting services to early stage startups and software product teams.

Not so long ago, computers read processing instructions from stiff pieces of paper called ["punched" cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card). The cards have 80 columns of numbers with 12 "punch" locations in each column. We named our firm around that bit of nostalgic simplicity.
