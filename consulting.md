## Build better web apps, faster.

![Henry Poydar](/images/henry-poydar.png)

Hi! I'm Henry Poydar. In addition to running 8012 Labs, I help web application product teams organize their Rails codebase and implement proven development and deployment practices.

All of the work I do with teams optimizes for development velocity, quality, efficient product management, performance, and continuous delivery.

Unlike other development consultants, I've been successfully building and deploying Rails apps like yours since 2005, including production applications serving millions of users.

I only work with one or two teams at a time, so you'll be working directly with me. I'll be bringing [20 years](https://linkedin.com/in/hpoydar) of web development and leadership experience to bear on your codebase and processes.

If you're interested, [let's get in touch](mailto:henry@8012labs.com).
